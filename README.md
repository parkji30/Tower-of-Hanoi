# Tower of Hanoi


(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

    Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks 
    and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
    No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks

Terminal Program
-------------------
The terminal version

```tour.py```

Shows a visual demonstration of the minimal amount of moves required to move the tower.

type
```python3 tour.py```
to run the program and see the algorithm solve the path.

GUI Program
-------------------
The gui version allows for the user to play the game and attempt to move the tower him/her self.

type
```python3 gui_controller.py```
and the following screen should appear.
